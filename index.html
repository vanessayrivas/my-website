<h3> 
  Visiting Banff is an unforgettable experience, but a little planning goes a long way. If you want to see Lake Louise, be sure to book your shuttle at least two days in advance since spots fill up 
  quickly. The weather can be unpredictable, so dress in layers—some areas stay chilly while hiking will warm you up fast. 
  Always carry bear spray, as wildlife encounters are a real possibility, and don’t forget to purchase your Banff National Park pass before heading out. 
  With preparation, you’ll be ready to enjoy the stunning scenery, crisp mountain air, and world-class trails.
